Python小史
-----------------
* Created by Guido van Rossum
    * first released in 1991, a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers;
    * Python 2.0 on October 2000，introducing a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode;
    * Python 3.0 on December 2008, not completely backward-compatible with previous versions, `What’s New In Python 3.0`_;
* Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
* Available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.

设计哲学
------------------
* Highly extensible
* Avoid premature optimization
* In favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar
* Keep it fun.

::

  Beautiful is better than ugly
  Explicit is better than implicit
  Simple is better than complex
  Complex is better than complicated
  Readability counts
                    -- the Zen of Python
